# NixOS and nix-darwin Configuration

This is a NixOS and Nix-darwin configuration project.
When providing assistance, please follow these guidelines:

- Use `nix-darwin` for macOS-specific configurations.
- Use `home-manager` for user-specific configurations.
- Use `agenix` for secrets management.

## Dont's

- Suggest using `nix-env` to install packages.
- Suggest using `nix-channel` to manage channels.
- Suggest packages that are not available in the configured nixpkgs version.
- Forget to use `lib.mkForce` when overriding existing configurations.

## Hints

- The project uses `agenix` for secrets, so don't suggest storing secrets in the Nix store.
- The project uses `flake-utils` to manage systems.
- When adding new packages, consider whether they should be in `home.packages` or `environment.systemPackages`.
- When making changes, always check if they affect both NixOS and Nix-darwin configurations.
